## How It Started

I was watching [injuly](https://injuly.in/)'s live video stream in the discord server [Zig India Discord](https://discord.gg/BwGez7Js) just for the vibe.
He was writing something in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) - can't remember what - but what caught my attention was
Zig's error handling using [try](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#try) and [catch](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#catch).
I liked the way it handled errors and immediately wanted something similar in JavaScript.

## Inspiration

import { RoughNotation } from 'react-rough-notation'

Let's take a look at the Zig's error handling with `catch` with an <RoughNotation 
    type="strike-through" 
    color="#9E7B5F" 
    show={true} 
    strokeWidth={2} 
    iterations={3} 
    animate={false}>good</RoughNotation> example.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) !i32 {
    if (b == 0) {
        return error.DivisionByZero;
    }
    return a / b;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    // Example 1: Using catch to provide a default value
    const result1 = divide(10, 0) catch 0;
    std.debug.print("Result with default: {}\n", .{result1});  // prints 0

    // Example 2: Using catch to handle the error
    const result2 = divide(10, 0) catch |err| {
        std.debug.print("Oops! {}\n", .{err});
        return err;
    };
}
```

Here, We handle the error at the same place where the function is called.
No new scope, no bulky `try-catch` block and no extra indentation. It's easy to read and understand.

## Zig's influence
I really wanted something similar in JavaScript. I tried creating classes and utility functions, but nothing worked
-until I realized we already have something similar in JavaScript, *it was staring me right in the face*.


To show Zig's way of error handling in JavaScript, I'm going to do something unconventional: 
 I'll make the `divide()` function asynchronous (now you know why **good** was stricken out). I'll come back to it this later.


Here you go:
```typescript
async function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("DivisionByZero");
    }
    return a / b;
}

async function main() {
    // Example 1: Using a default value with .catch()
    let result1 = await divide(10, 0).catch((_) => 0);
    console.log(`Result with default: ${result1}`); // prints 0

    // Example 2: Handling the error explicitly
    const result2 = await divide(10, 0).catch((err) => {
      console.log(`Oops! ${err.message}`);
      throw err;
    });
    console.log(`Result: ${result2}`);
}

main();
```
I did not use a `try-catch` block at all, and it looks very similar 
to Zig's `catch` block. Practically, it's the same thing.


Making the `divide()` function asynchronous isn't ideal or recommended;[^1] this was just to illustrate the concept.
Most of the time, we (backend people) deal with asynchronous functions anyway.

Another way to do it is to use a utility function.
```typescript
async function $try<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  fn: T
): Promise<ReturnType<T>> {
  return await fn()
}
```

We can use it like this:
````typescript
let _ = await $try(() => divide(10, 1)).catch((_) => 0);
````

But as you can see, it clutters the call site, making it hard to read.

#### What about synchronous functions then?

We can use following utility function which has the same API as the above one:

```typescript
const $try = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(fn: T) => {
  const Catch = class {
    constructor(private readonly value: T) { }

    catch(fn: (err: unknown) => ReturnType<T> | never): ReturnType<T> {
      try {
        return this.value()
      } catch (err) {
        return fn(err)
      }
    }
  }

  return new Catch(fn)
}
```

`try` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, we have to settle for `$try` or `try_`-whichever suits you.
`$try()` returns an anonymous class with a `catch()` method that takes a synchronous error handler.

```typescript
function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("DivisionByZero");
    }
    return a / b;
}

function main() {
    // Example 1: Using a default value with .catch()
    let result1 = $try(() => divide(10, 0)).catch((_) => 0);
    console.log(`Result with default: ${result1}`); // prints 0

    // Example 2: Handling the error explicitly
    const result2 = $try(() => divide(10, 0)).catch((err) => {
      console.log(`Oops! ${(err as any).message}`);
      throw err;
    });
    console.log(`Result: ${result2}`);
}

main();
```

I do prefer to handle errors at the call site, but I like to experiment with different styles to see if they make code more readable.

Cheerio!

<p style={{ 
    marginTop: '64px', 
    color: '#666666', 
    textAlign: 'center', 
    fontStyle: 'italic' 
}}>
  Don't Lose the Rhythm
</p>


[^1]: Well, It depends, If you have huge synchronous task, you don't wanna [hog the
    event-loop](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/dont-block-the-event-loop), you might consider to divide the work into smaller chunks and
    handle them asynchronously. I just don't wanna make synchronous functions
    asynchronous it's misleading.
